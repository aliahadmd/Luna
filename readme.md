# AI Text Assistant

A Chrome extension that provides AI-powered text processing capabilities. The extension allows users to select text on a webpage and receive an AI-generated response, displayed in a popup near the selected text.

## Overview

This extension uses Chrome's Manifest V3 architecture and integrates with Google's Generative Language API to provide AI-powered text analysis and responses.

## Features

- AI-powered text processing
- Context-aware responses
- Typing effect for responses
- Position-aware popup display
- Customizable styling
- Content script injection

## Requirements

- Chrome browser (version supporting Manifest V3)
- Internet connection
- Google Generative Language API access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory

## Usage

1. Select text on any webpage

## Architecture

### Background Script (background.js)
- Handles communication between the extension and content scripts
- Manages injection of content scripts and styles
- Implements retry logic for message passing

### Content Script (content.js)
- Displays the AI response in a position-aware container
- Implements the typing effect for responses
- Handles user interaction (closing the popup)

### Manifest (manifest.json)
- Defines the extension's permissions and structure
- Specifies content scripts and styling
- Declares dependencies and required permissions

## Known Limitations
